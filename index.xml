      <description>In this post we will derive the Y-combinator from first principles.
In other words, we will invent a reusable way to use recursion in lambda calculus.
Step 1:
Start with a function \( f \) whose implementation is self-referencing. Then the body of \( f \) must look like:
\[ f = ...f...f... \] Here we use \( ... \) to denote any lambda calculus expression.
Step 2:
Instead of hardcoding \( f \) in the body, let&amp;rsquo;s factor out \( f \) :</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I will introduce Machine Learning (ML). If you want to get deeper on any of these topics, just reach out.
AI &amp;amp; ML Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are often conflated, but they are not the same. Rather, ML is a subset of AI.
Deep Learning is a subset of ML and will be discussed at the end of this post.
  AI is “intelligence demonstrated by machines&amp;hellip;that mimic cognitive functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as learning and problem solving”.</description>

      <description>When I first learned React ⚛, it took me less than a day to run into the ol&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;controlled vs uncontrolled components&amp;rdquo; dichotomy. At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the terms &amp;ldquo;controlled&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;uncontrolled&amp;rdquo;, but still struggled to fit my designs into these two buckets.
The tension was between 2 competing goals:
 I want to make my components as reusable as possible My use-cases were similar, but not exactly the same&amp;hellip;  Here&amp;rsquo;s a checkbox component that takes care of styling and toggling when clicked.</description>

      <description>The subprocess module from the Python standard library makes it easy to start processes from within your Python script.
But, it gets more complex if:
 You need to run the subprocess concurrently with your script The subprocess creates its own child processes  In my case, I had a Flask server that needed to be running while my experiment script ran since my script made API calls to the server.</description>
