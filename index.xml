      <description>When I first learned React ⚛, it took me less than a day to run into the ol&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;controlled vs uncontrolled components&amp;rdquo; dichotomy. At the time, I didn&#39;t even know the terms &amp;ldquo;controlled&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;uncontrolled&amp;rdquo;, but was still struggling to fit the designs in my head into those two buckets.
The tension was between 2 competing goals:

 You need to run the subprocess concurrently with your script The subprocess creates its own child processes  In my case, I had a Flask server that needed to be running while my experiment script ran since my script made API calls to the server.</description>
